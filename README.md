# Jumpscale

Jumpscale is a cloud automation product and a branch from what used to be 
Pylabs. About 9 years ago Pylabs was the basis of a cloud automation product 
which was acquired by SUN Microsystems from Q-Layer. In the mean time we are 
4 versions further and we have rebranded it to Jumpscale. 
Our newest release is version 10, called JSX.
