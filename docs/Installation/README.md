## Container Install
Here we will install jumpscale using container-install option which will create a docker-container for you and install jumpscale within it. we have 2 types of installation as the following<br/>

- #### Interactive Container
    In here you will be asked to provide a secret and to authenticate github cloning in the middle of installation. make sure to add your ssh-key to your github account's authenticated keys
    - #### steps for installation
    - 1- install the prerequisites
    - 2- download the installation file, make it executable, then run it
        ```bash
        # download
        curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threefoldtech/jumpscaleX/development_jumpscale/install/jsx.py?$RANDOM > /tmp/jsx ;\
        # change permission
        chmod +x /tmp/jsx; \
        # install
        /tmp/jsx container-install
        ```
- #### Non Interactive Container
    This type of installation won't ask you about anything
    - 1- install the prerequisites
    - 2- download the installation file, make it executable, configure the installation with your secret, then run it.
        ```bash
        # download
        curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threefoldtech/jumpscaleX/development_jumpscale/install/jsx.py?$RANDOM > /tmp/jsx;\
        # change permission
        chmod +x /tmp/jsx;\
        # configure with your secret - replace mysecret with yours`
        /tmp/jsx configure --no-interactive -s mysecret;\
        # install
        /tmp/jsx container-install --no-interactive
        ```

## InSystem Install
Here we will install jumpscale using install option which willinstall jumpscale within your local system. we also have 2 types of installation as the following<br/>

- #### Interactive InSystem
    In here you will be asked to provide a secret and to authenticate github cloning in the middle of installation. make sure to add your ssh-key to your github account's authenticated keys

    - 1- install the prerequisites
    - 2- download the installation file, make it executable, then run it
        ```bash
        # download
        curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threefoldtech/jumpscaleX/development_jumpscale/install/jsx.py?$RANDOM > /tmp/jsx ;\
        # change permission
        chmod +x /tmp/jsx; \
        # install
        /tmp/jsx install 
        ```

- #### Non Interactive InSystem
    This type of installation won't ask you about anything
    - 1- install the prerequisites
    - 2- download the installation file, make it executable,configure the installation with your secret, then run it

        /tmp/jsx install --no-interactive
        ```

## Extra options
also there's some more intersting options to use
- #### reset
    - Will restart the installation

        /tmp/jsx container-install -w
        ```
- #### jsx command help
    - get more information about other options
        ```bash
        #get more help of jsx command
        /tmp/jsx --help
        ``` 

## Advanced Installation
it is easy to develop on the installer, will install from existing code on your system

```bash
#create directory, make sure your user has full access to this director (can be a manual step)
mkdir -p /sandbox/code/github/threefoldtech
cd /sandbox/code/github/threefoldtech;
#if you have a permission denied add sudo at the beginning of the command
# then do a sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /sandbox
git clone git@github.com:threefoldtech/jumpscaleX.git; cd jumpscaleX;
git checkout development
git pull

#link the installer from tmp to the source directory, makes it easy for the rest of this tutorial
rm -f /tmp/jsx.py
rm -f /tmp/InstallTools.py;
ln -s /sandbox/code/github/threefoldtech/jumpscaleX/install/jsx.py /tmp/jsx;
ln -s /sandbox/code/github/threefoldtech/jumpscaleX/install/InstallTools.py /tmp/InstallTools.py
```

## after-installation
### How to use Jumpscale X

To start JumpcaleX:
The install script has built and started a docker container named `3bot` on your machine.
```bash
# get your kosmos shell (inside your 3bot container)
/tmp/jsx container-kosmos
```
Once kosmos is launched you will see this line:
```bash
JSX>
```
Congrats ! You may now use this jsx shell to manipulate the Jumpscale X library 

If jsx is missing from your `/tmp` folder:

```bash
# get the jsx command
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threefoldtech/jumpscaleX/development_installer/install/jsx.py?$RANDOM > /tmp/jsx ; \
chmod +x /tmp/jsx; \
# get your kosmos shell (inside your 3bot container)
/tmp/jsx container-kosmos
```

JSX is the main tool for working with a jumpscale deployment

- install
- export/import docker containers
- export BCDB data (coming soon)
- access the kosmos shell in container
- configure your local or container JSX

see [JSX](jsx.md) for more info
