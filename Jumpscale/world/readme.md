# World

Manages services in the world.
Each directory corresponds to a coordinator which manages one or more services.

## remarks

- building never done here (thats done in the builders section)
- only works with remote services (e.g. a zos node)
- uses clients to connect to the remote service e.g. zosprotocol

## future

- will have monitoring & live cycle management inside
